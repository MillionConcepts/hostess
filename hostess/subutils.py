         Execute a shell command parsed from `args` and `kwargs`.

         This method has two legal calling conventions along with a variety of
         keyword-argument meta-options that modify _how_ it executes the shell
         command. The meta-options are not defined in the signature in order
         to facilitate the parsing process.

         **Meta-options:**

         RunCommand understands any kwarg whose name begins with `'_'` as a
         meta-option, unless the remainder of the kwarg name is numeric (e.g.
         `'_0'`). All meta-options are optional. Internally-recognized
         meta-options:

         * `_bg` (aliases `_asynchronous`, `_async`): if True, execute the
             process in the background. Roughly equivalent to the '&' control
             operator in bash. If False, block until process exit. (Default
             False)
         * `_out` (alias `_out_stream`): Additional target for process stdout.
             Must have a `write()` method. (If `_viewer=True`, defaults to
             `Viewer`'s default behavior. Otherwise, defaults to a `Nullify`
             object, which simply discards the stream).
         * `_err` (alias `_err_stream`): Same as `_out`, but for stderr.
         * `_viewer` (alias `_v`): if True, return a `Viewer` object permitting
             additional process inspection and management. `_viewer=True`
             implies `_bg=True`. (default False)
         * `_args_at_end`: if True, place positional arguments other than the
             command string at the end of the parsed shell command, after any
             shell options parsed from kwargs. Otherwise, place them before
             shell options. (Default True)
         * `_done`: a niladic function to call on process exit. Valid only if
           `_viewer=True`.

         Any other meta-options are passed directly to the underlying Runner as
         keyword arguments with `"_"` stripped from their names. `_disown` is
         often particularly useful.

         **Calling conventions:**

         These conventions are not mutually exclusive, although it is
         generally less confusing to pick one or the other.

         **1**

         Pass the shell command as a string. This can be simpler in many cases,
         and is mandatory for programs with non-standard calling conventions,
         like the `ffmpeg` command below.

         Examples:

             >>> cmd = RunCommand()
             >>> cmd('ls')
             >>> cmd('cp -r /path/to/folder /path/to/other/folder')
             >>> cmd('ffmpeg -i first.mp4 -filter:v "crop=100:10:20:200" second.mp4')

         **2**

         Construct the shell command using multiple arguments to `__call__`.
         This allows you to treat the shell command more like a Python
         function, which can be simpler and less error-prone than dynamic
         string formatting when you would like to pass variable parameters to a
         command.

         RunCommand uses the following rules to parse args and kwargs into
         shell command strings. They are compatible with most, although not
         all, shell programs:

        * RunCommand treats the first positional argument like a shell command
          name. This means that passing a positional argument is mandatory if
          you did not bind a command to the RunCommand when creating it. The
          parsed command string always starts with this argument.
        * Subsequent positional arguments are command parameters. By
          default, the parser places them at the end of the command string,
          after any command options. Pass `_args_at_end=False` to place them
          before command options.
        * Keyword arguments are command options. The parser transforms
          keyword argument names in order to make Python naming and calling
          conventions compatible with shell conventions.
            * It ignores `"_"` characters at the start and end of
              names. This can be used to pass numeric options, like
              `"_0=True"`, or options that share a name with a Python
              reserved keyword, like `"dir_=/opt"`.
            * it treats single-character names (not counting prefixed or
              suffixed `"_"`) as options preceded by a `"-"` and does not
              use an `'='` to separate them from their values.
              `cmd("ls", I="a*")` is equivalent to `"ls -I a*"`.
            * it treats longer names as options preceded by `"--"` and uses
              an `'='` to separate them from their values.
              `cmd("ls", width=20)` is equivalent to `"ls --width=20"`.
            * It replaces `"_"` characters within names with `"-"`.
              `cmd("ls", time_style="iso")` is equivalent to
              `"ls --time-style=iso"`.
            * if a keyword argument is True, RunCommand treats it as a
              "switch". `cmd("ls", a=True)` is equivalent to `"ls -a"`.
            * if a keyword argument is False, RunCommand ignores it.
              `cmd("ls", a=False)` is equivalent to `"ls"`.

         In addition to these conventions, bear in mind that if you specified a
         command when you construct a RunCommand object, that command will
         always be used as the first positional argument to `__call__`, and if
         you specified kwargs, they will be added to any kwargs you pass or
         don't pass to `__call__`.
