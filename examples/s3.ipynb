    "# examples for `hostess.aws.s3`\n",
    "\n",
    "## introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`hostess.aws.s3` is a collection of utilities for working with S3 \n",
    "objects. Its centerpiece is a class called `Bucket`, which offers\n",
    "a straightforward interface to a single S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "### capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "`hostess.aws.s3` is designed as a streamlined alternative to `boto3`'s\n",
    "high-level S3 API. It is intended to make it easy to integrate S3 \n",
    "objects into Python workflows without writing a lot of boilerplate. \n",
    "It makes read/write operations extremely simple, including reads and \n",
    "writes from and to in-memory Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to simple I/O operations, it offers special functionality \n",
    "for several types of tasks that are frequently encountered when working \n",
    "with \"big data\" on S3, but are not straightforward to execute with \n",
    "existing tools, specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* building searchable indices of buckets containing many objects\n",
    "* modifying object storage classes\n",
    "* writing larger-than-memory or intermittently-streamed data\n",
    "  to S3 objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "`hostess.aws.s3` does not provide interfaces for S3 administrative \n",
    "operations, including creating and deleting buckets or managing\n",
    "object and bucket permissions. If you need to perform automated S3 \n",
    "admin tasks of this type, you will need to supplement `hostess` with \n",
    "something such as `boto3`, `awscli`, the AWS Web Console. (`hostess.aws` \n",
    "does offer some generic utilities to make using `boto3` easier.) `hostess` \n",
    "may expand its S3 administrative capabilities in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have no valid AWS credentials, `hostess.aws` (like any other AWS \n",
    "interface) will not function. By default, `hostess` uses the 'default' \n",
    "profile from ~/.aws/credentials. This can be modified in \n",
    "`hostess.config.user_config` or by manually constructing a `boto3` session \n",
    "or client with `init_session` or `init_client` from `hostess.aws.utilities`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You need appropriate AWS permissions, both for the specific API call you're\n",
    "making and the specific S3 resources you wish to access. You cannot,\n",
    "for instance, use `Bucket.ls()` without the ListObjectsV2 permission, or\n",
    "`Bucket.put()` without the PutObject permission. \n",
    "\n",
    "A complete discussion of AWS credential and permissions management is beyond \n",
    "the scope of this document. For overviews, please refer to AWS documentation on \n",
    "[account creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html),\n",
    "[credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html),\n",
    "and [S3 permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-policy-language-overview.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### note and caveat\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through the creation of an s3 bucket using your \n",
    "available AWS credentials and then put data into that bucket. This will start to\n",
    "incur costs attached to your AWS credentials. If this tutorial is run\n",
    "without modification, then the total costs should be approximately one fifth of \n",
    "a cent -- less than the electricity you are using to run your computer. However,\n",
    "if this is unacceptable to you or makes you uncomfortable,\n",
    "you should proceed with caution or not at all. We (the authors of `hostess`)\n",
    "disclaim responsibility. (See the appendix for a breakdown of estimated costs.)"

    "### general s3 notes and vocab\n",
    "\n",
    "As one more preliminary, we'd like to make a few quick notes about S3. These \n",
    "notes aren't specific to `hostess`. They're statements about S3 in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 objects are designed to look a lot like files, S3 buckets\n",
    "are designed to look a lot like filesystems, and in many cases, they \n",
    "can be used like files and filesystems. They aren't, though,\n",
    "and we prefer to use precise vocabulary to emphasize the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full name of an S3 object is called its **_object key name_** or just **_key_**. \n",
    "This includes its full 'path' in addition to its 'file name'. The components of the\n",
    "'path' prior to the 'file name' are called **_prefixes_**. Prefixes are loosely\n",
    "analogous to directories in a filesystem, and interfaces often\n",
    "display them as if they were. However, prefixes are not actually directories,\n",
    "and a key is not actually a path. Directories are a type of file, but \n",
    "prefixes are just \n",
    "[\"a string of characters at the beginning of the object key name\"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-prefixes.html) that can be used to help organize objects and permissions. \n",
    "They cannot be renamed/moved, given AWS resource tags, or otherwise directly manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, unlike files, S3 objects also cannot be renamed / moved. \"Moving\" an\n",
    "S3 object always means making a complete copy of it with a different key\n",
    "and subsequently deleting the original, even if the new copy is in the \n",
    "same \"filesystem\" (bucket). It is no slower to copy an object\n",
    "from one bucket to another than to copy an object within the same\n",
    "bucket (unless the buckets are in different AWS Regions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, unlike files, S3 objects are immutable. Although it is possible to read\n",
    "just a portion of an S3 object, it is not possible to perform incremental\n",
    "writes to an S3 object. Anything that looks like a tail-write to an S3\n",
    "object actually overwrites the whole object with a slightly modified\n",
    "copy of itself. This tends to be horribly inefficient. Multipart uploads\n",
    "provide the closest approximation to 'real' tail-writes, and they don't\n",
    "actually create accessible objects until they're completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a diagnostic tip\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are having trouble accessing an S3 resource via `hostess`, you can\n",
    "quickly rule out some basic possibilities by calling `hostess.aws.utilities.whoami()`. \n",
    "This function performs an API call that is *always* available to any AWS account, \n",
    "even if an administrator specifically tries to deny it \n",
    "([STS GetCallerIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetCallerIdentity.html)).\n",
    "If it fails, either there is something wrong with your account credentials, or some network \n",
    "issue is preventing you from accessing an AWS API endpoint. If it doesn't, the problem\n",
    "is with access to the resource or API action. Permissions might be wrong, the\n",
    "resource might not exist, it might be in a different region than expected, or your\n",
    "network is specifically blocking access to that resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `hostess.aws.s3`'s relationship to `boto3` (advanced topic)\n",
    "\n",
    "`hostess.aws.s3` works primarily as a high-level interface to `boto3`'s low-level S3 API. Due to philosophical differences, it makes almost no use of the `boto3` high-level `Bucket` object, and should be considered a reimagining of that object rather than a wrapper for it. `hostess` `Buckets` do not automatically instantiate or grant access to `boto3` `Buckets`. However, they *do* wrap `boto3` client, resource, and session objects. If users require access to portions of the S3 API not included in `hostess`, they may reference these attributes of a `hostess` `Bucket` in order to perform API calls using the same session/client/resource that underlies the methods of their `hostess` `Bucket`. They may even use them to instantiate a similarly-configured `boto3` `Bucket`, if they would like things to get confusing.\n",
