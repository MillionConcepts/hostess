    "# examples for `hostess.aws.ec2`\n",
    "\n",
    "### introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`hostess.aws.ec2` is a collection of utilities for working with EC2 instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Instance` and `Cluster` are its centerpiece classes. They are abstractions for, \n",
    "respectively, single EC2 instances and groups of EC2 instances. By offering both\n",
    "managed interaction with the EC2 API and a rich set of remote procedure call (RPC)\n",
    "capabilities, they attempt to make distributed workflows as conceptually simple and \n",
    "immediate as local ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "### requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You need appropriate AWS permissions to perform any actions that call the\n",
    "    EC2 API. You cannot, for instance, use `ls_instances()` without the ListInstances\n",
    "    permission, or `Instance.start()` without StartInstances permission for the\n",
    "    particular instance you are attempting to start. (A complete discussion of AWS\n",
    "    permissions management is beyond the scope of this document.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    By default, `hostess` uses the 'default' profile from ~/.aws/credentials.\n",
    "    This can be modified in `hostess.config.user_config` or by manually constructing\n",
    "    a session with `hostess.aws.utils.init_session`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    If you are in a situation where you have SSH access to, but not AWS permissions for, \n",
    "    an EC2 instance you'd like to make `hostess` RPCs on, you should ignore the fact that\n",
    "    it is an EC2 instance and simply use `hostess.ssh.SSH`, which underlies the RPC\n",
    "    capabilities of this module.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. The RPC functionality offered by this module relies on SSH, so you need SSH access to an\n",
    "   instance to make RPCs on it. Specifically:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. The instance must be running `sshd` and configured to accept incoming connections.\n",
    "      You generally will not have to do anything special to set this up: the default\n",
    "      configuration of most stock AMIs, including the Ubuntu and Amazon Linux images, is\n",
    "      suitable.\n",
    "   2. The inbound traffic rules of the instance's security group must permit SSH access\n",
    "      from your IP.\n",
    "   3. `hostess` supports only keyfile-based authentication, so you must have the correct\n",
    "      keyfile for the instance, and `hostess` must be able to find it. If it shares a\n",
    "      filename with the key name known to AWS and is in your `~/.ssh` folder, `hostess`\n",
    "      will find it automatically. If this is not the case, you can manually specify a\n",
    "      path to the keyfile when constructing an `Instance` or `Cluster`. You can also change\n",
    "      the default search paths in `hostess.config.user_config`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *note: if you want to create remote workflows without relying on SSH connections, we recommend\n",
    "   looking at the `hostess.station` framework.* \n",
    "\n",
    "### relationship to `boto3`\n",
    "\n",
    "`aws.ec2.Instance` is designed to be easier to use, more Pythonic, and more powerful than `boto3`'s \n",
    "`Instance` abstraction. However, it does not implement high-level interfaces for the entirety \n",
    "of the EC2 API. Because it works partly by wrapping parts of `boto3`, however, every `aws.ec2.Instance` \n",
    "also grants access to a `boto3` `Instance` object with a shared AWS configuration. If \n",
    "you need access to other parts of the EC2 API inside a `hostess` workflow, you can access this object\n",
    "via the `aws.ec2.Instance._instance` attribute."
