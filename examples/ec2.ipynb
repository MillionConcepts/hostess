    "# examples for `hostess.aws.ec2`\n",
    "\n",
    "### introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`hostess.aws.ec2` is a collection of utilities for working with EC2 instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Instance` and `Cluster` are its centerpiece classes. They are abstractions for, \n",
    "respectively, single EC2 instances and groups of EC2 instances. By offering both\n",
    "managed interaction with the EC2 API and a rich set of remote procedure call (RPC)\n",
    "capabilities, they attempt to make distributed workflows as conceptually simple and \n",
    "immediate as local ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "### requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You need appropriate AWS permissions to perform any actions that call the\n",
    "    EC2 API. You cannot, for instance, use `ls_instances()` without the ListInstances\n",
    "    permission, or `Instance.start()` without StartInstances permission for the\n",
    "    particular instance you are attempting to start. (A complete discussion of AWS\n",
    "    permissions management is beyond the scope of this document.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    By default, `hostess` uses the 'default' profile from ~/.aws/credentials.\n",
    "    This can be modified in `hostess.config.user_config` or by manually constructing\n",
    "    a client with `hostess.aws.utils.init_client`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    If you are in a situation where you have SSH access to, but not AWS permissions for, \n",
    "    an EC2 instance you'd like to make `hostess` RPCs on, you should ignore the fact that\n",
    "    it is an EC2 instance and simply use `hostess.ssh.SSH`, which underlies the RPC\n",
    "    capabilities of this module.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. The RPC functionality offered by this module relies on SSH, so you need SSH access to an\n",
    "   instance to make RPCs on it. Specifically:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    1. The inbound traffic rules of the instance's security group must permit SSH access\n",
    "       from your IP. (If you create a security group with `hostess`, it will set this up\n",
    "       automatically.)\n",
    "    2. `hostess` supports only keyfile-based authentication, so you must have the correct\n",
    "      keyfile for the instance, and `hostess` must be able to find it. If it shares a\n",
    "      filename with the key name known to AWS and is in your `~/.ssh` folder, `hostess`\n",
    "      will find it automatically. If this is not the case, you can manually specify a\n",
    "      path to the keyfile when constructing an `Instance` or `Cluster`. You can also change\n",
    "      the default search paths in `hostess.config.user_config`. (If you create a security\n",
    "      group with `hostess`, it will also generate a compatible keyfile and save it into\n",
    "      your `~/.ssh` folder.) \n",
    "    3. The instance must be running `sshd` and configured to accept incoming connections.\n",
    "      You generally will not have to do anything special to set this up: the default\n",
    "      configuration of most stock AMIs, including the Ubuntu and Amazon Linux images, is\n",
    "      suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *note: if you want to create remote workflows without relying on SSH connections, we recommend\n",
    "   looking at the `hostess.station` framework.* \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### note and caveat\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through the creation of several EC2 instances and\n",
    "associated EBS volumes. This will incur costs attached to your AWS credentials.\n",
    "If this tutorial is run without modification, the total costs should be very \n",
    "small (approximately 11 cents). However, if this \n",
    "is unacceptable to you or makes you uncomfortable, you should proceed with \n",
    "caution or not at all. We (the authors of `hostess`) disclaim responsibility. \n",
    "(See the appendix for a breakdown of estimated costs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### relationship to `boto3`\n",
    "\n",
    "`aws.ec2.Instance` is designed to be easier to use, more Pythonic, and more powerful than `boto3`'s \n",
    "`Instance` abstraction. However, it does not implement high-level interfaces for the entirety \n",
    "of the EC2 API. Because it works partly by wrapping parts of `boto3`, however, every `aws.ec2.Instance` \n",
    "also grants access to a `boto3` `Instance` object with a shared AWS configuration. If \n",
    "you need access to other parts of the EC2 API inside a `hostess` workflow, you can access this object\n",
    "via the `aws.ec2.Instance.instance_` attribute."

    "## 1. launching instances\n",
    "\n",
    "`Instance` can be used both to work with existing instances and launch new ones.\n",
    "In this section, we'll launch an instance to work with in subsequent sections.\n",
    "We should discuss some preliminaries first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: `hostess` performs no automated instance lifecycle management\n",
    "due to its potential to cause process disruption and unintended data loss. \n",
    "If you want to stop or terminate an instance, you must do so explicitly,\n",
    "using methods of the `Instance` object, other interfaces to the EC2 API, shutdown\n",
    "commands on the instance itself, or the EC2 web console. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. instance configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### launch templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's not mandatory, the easiest and cleanest way to launch instances with \n",
    "`hostess` is to use an existing launch template and give `Instance.launch()` the name\n",
    "of the template.\n",
    "(On the backend, this is because the API requires a launch template to launch an \n",
    "instance, and reusing the same launch template helps ensure consistent behavior).\n",
    "You can create a launch template using `aws.ec2.create_launch_template()`, \n",
    "other interfaces to the EC2 API, or the EC2 web console. \n",
    "**TODO: template parameter overrides are a planned feature. update this when finished.** \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't do this, `hostess` just creates a 'scratch' template to launch the \n",
    "instance and deletes it immediately after launch (whether successful or failed).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "The EC2 API requires explicit specification of a lot of parameters to launch an instance.\n",
    "`hostess` wants to make it easy to launch instances, so if you don't explicitly\n",
    "specify some or all of these parameters, it populates them with sensible\n",
    "defaults. You can override the following defaults in `hostess.aws.config.user_config`:\n",
    "* instance_type (instance type, like 't3a.micro')\n",
    "* volume_type (root EBS volume type, like 'gp3')\n",
    "* volume_size (root EBS volume size in GB)\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO: complete description of valid `options`**\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of default behaviors are worth special consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you don't specify a security group, either in a launch template or\n",
    "  the 'security_group_name' item of `options`, `hostess` acts like\n",
    "  the EC2 web console's launch wizard and creates a new\n",
    "  security group.\n",
    "  * These auto-generated security groups are named 'hostess-'\n",
    "    followed by 10 random lowercase letters. They permit all outgoing traffic\n",
    "    from their members, and permit incoming traffic on:\n",
    "    * the standard SSH port (22) from your current IP\n",
    "    * any port from other AWS resources in the same security group.\n",
    "  * this also generates an SSH keyfile and saves it to your ~/.ssh folder. Its\n",
    "    filename is the same as the name of its associated security group.\n",
    "  * `hostess` does **not** provide automated lifecycle management for these security\n",
    "    groups (this is because deleting security groups associated with running\n",
    "    instances is impossible, and deleting security groups associated with stopped\n",
    "    instances can make them unusable).\n",
    "    This has the same issue as the EC2 launch wizard: it can leave your account\n",
    "    cluttered with old security groups, which are harmless but unsightly. It can\n",
    "    also leave your .ssh folder confusingly cluttered with keyfiles. It's\n",
    "    better to reuse existing security groups.\n",
    "* If you don't specify an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), either in a launch template\n",
    "  or in the 'image_id' item of `options`, `hostess` uses the most recent\n",
    "  Ubuntu Server LTS AMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. executing `Instance.launch()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hostess` defaults are permissive enough that you can make a new instance\n",
    "with default configuration simply by calling `Instance.launch()` with no arguments. \n",
    "However, we'll show a preferred workflow here."

    "#### tips for `Instance.notebook()`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `notebook()` launches Jupyter daemonized. This means \n",
    "   that if you lose your connection for whatever reason,\n",
    "   whatever Jupyter might have been doing on the instance\n",
    "   will not stop. You can even reestablish a tunnel to\n",
    "   the instance and continue working.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   It also means that if you kill the launch process \n",
    "   (`launch` in the example above), it won't stop Jupyter \n",
    "   in the way hitting CTRL-C does when you run it in an interactive \n",
    "   session. `notebook()`, however, returns a function that you can call \n",
    "   to gracefully shut down Jupyter (`stopper` in the \n",
    "   example above). If something's gone very wrong with Jupyter\n",
    "   and this doesn't work, take the gloves off and run\n",
    "   `Instance.command('killall jupyter-noteboo')`. Also, if you \n",
    "   *want* Jupyter to shut down when you disconnect,\n",
    "   you can pass `kill_on_exit=True` to `notebook()`, although\n",
    "   this isn't guaranteed to work if your local Python process\n",
    "   segfaults or something.\n",
    "2. `notebook()` also returns a Process object encapsulating \n",
    "   the SSH tunnel, along with metadata about the tunnel (`tunnel` \n",
    "   and `tunnel_info` in the example above). If something\n",
    "   goes wrong with the tunnel, inspecting these can be useful.\n",
    "3. Finally, `notebook()` returns a `Viewer` for the process that \n",
    "   actually launched Jupyter (`launch` in the example above). \n",
    "   Examining this can be useful as a diagnostic for Jupyter-level \n",
    "   issues. Unless you pass `kill_on_exit=True`, killing this process \n",
    "   won't actually kill Jupyter; it'll just keep you from receiving \n",
    "   its console output.\n",
    "4. Conventions for controlling Jupyter have changed with Notebook 7.\n",
    "   We do not guarantee backwards compatibility with earlier versions\n",
    "   of Notebook."

    "* as you've seen, you normally don't have to manually establish an SSH connection to\n",

    "requires a connection. However, the `connect()` method can be used to ensure that you \n",

    "on your first command when you get to that part of a program.\n",
    "    * this method does nothing if a connection is already open.\n",
    "* you might also want to close an existing connection and open a new one -- for\n",
    "instance, if you lost track of a bunch of processes or the connection gets externally\n",
    "disrupted in a weird way. you can do this with the `reconnect()` method.\n",
    "    * this will immediately terminate all non-daemonized processes executed\n",
    "over the exiting connection and close any established tunnels / forwarded ports.\n",
    "    * if no connection is currently open, `reconnect()` is equivalent to `connect()`.\n",
    "* By default, EC2 uses a strict IP allowlist to gate incoming traffic to instances. \n",
    "This provides extremely good security, and `hostess` mimics this behavior by default. However,\n",
    "this means that if your IP address changes, you won't be able to connect to your instances\n",
    "anymore until you modify their security group settings. This can be a big hassle if you're \n",
    "on a cell network, using a VPN with IP hopping, or simply moving around a lot.\n",
    "`Instance.rebase_ssh_ingress_ip()` can quickly solve this issue for you: it modifies the \n",
    "security groups associated with an instance to permit SSH access from your IP.\n",
    "    * **IMPORTANT:** this method revokes all other ingress permissions. Do not use\n",
    "    it if you need an instance to be accessible to anyone or anything but you. This may change in the future.\n",
    "* If you'd like to establish an SSH tunnel on a specific port so that you can access some service on the instance in another application, you can call `tunnel(local_port, remote_port)`. For instance, if you launched a Notebook on the instance using the earlier cell, and then dropped connection for some reason, you could reestablish the tunnel with `Instance.tunnel(12358, 10001)` and go back to whatever you were doing in Notebook. Same deal for anything from PostgreSQL (5432) to DOOM (666)."
