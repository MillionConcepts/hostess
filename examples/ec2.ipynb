    "# examples for `hostess.aws.ec2`\n",
    "\n",
    "### introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`hostess.aws.ec2` is a collection of utilities for working with EC2 instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Instance` and `Cluster` are its centerpiece classes. They are abstractions for, \n",
    "respectively, single EC2 instances and groups of EC2 instances. By offering both\n",
    "managed interaction with the EC2 API and a rich set of remote procedure call (RPC)\n",
    "capabilities, they attempt to make distributed workflows as conceptually simple and \n",
    "immediate as local ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "### requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You need appropriate AWS permissions to perform any actions that call the\n",
    "    EC2 API. You cannot, for instance, use `ls_instances()` without the ListInstances\n",
    "    permission, or `Instance.start()` without StartInstances permission for the\n",
    "    particular instance you are attempting to start. (A complete discussion of AWS\n",
    "    permissions management is beyond the scope of this document.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    By default, `hostess` uses the 'default' profile from ~/.aws/credentials.\n",
    "    This can be modified in `hostess.config.user_config` or by manually constructing\n",
    "    a client with `hostess.aws.utils.init_client`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    If you are in a situation where you have SSH access to, but not AWS permissions for, \n",
    "    an EC2 instance you'd like to make `hostess` RPCs on, you should ignore the fact that\n",
    "    it is an EC2 instance and simply use `hostess.ssh.SSH`, which underlies the RPC\n",
    "    capabilities of this module.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. The RPC functionality offered by this module relies on SSH, so you need SSH access to an\n",
    "   instance to make RPCs on it. Specifically:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    1. The inbound traffic rules of the instance's security group must permit SSH access\n",
    "       from your IP. (If you create a security group with `hostess`, it will set this up\n",
    "       automatically.)\n",
    "    2. `hostess` supports only keyfile-based authentication, so you must have the correct\n",
    "      keyfile for the instance, and `hostess` must be able to find it. If it shares a\n",
    "      filename with the key name known to AWS and is in your `~/.ssh` folder, `hostess`\n",
    "      will find it automatically. If this is not the case, you can manually specify a\n",
    "      path to the keyfile when constructing an `Instance` or `Cluster`. You can also change\n",
    "      the default search paths in `hostess.config.user_config`. (If you create a security\n",
    "      group with `hostess`, it will also generate a compatible keyfile and save it into\n",
    "      your `~/.ssh` folder.) \n",
    "    3. The instance must be running `sshd` and configured to accept incoming connections.\n",
    "      You generally will not have to do anything special to set this up: the default\n",
    "      configuration of most stock AMIs, including the Ubuntu and Amazon Linux images, is\n",
    "      suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *note: if you want to create remote workflows without relying on SSH connections, we recommend\n",
    "   looking at the `hostess.station` framework.* \n",
    "\n",
    "### relationship to `boto3`\n",
    "\n",
    "`aws.ec2.Instance` is designed to be easier to use, more Pythonic, and more powerful than `boto3`'s \n",
    "`Instance` abstraction. However, it does not implement high-level interfaces for the entirety \n",
    "of the EC2 API. Because it works partly by wrapping parts of `boto3`, however, every `aws.ec2.Instance` \n",
    "also grants access to a `boto3` `Instance` object with a shared AWS configuration. If \n",
    "you need access to other parts of the EC2 API inside a `hostess` workflow, you can access this object\n",
    "via the `aws.ec2.Instance.instance_` attribute."

    "We should discuss some preliminaries first.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2a. instance configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### launch templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's not mandatory, the easiest and cleanest way to launch instances with \n",
    "`hostess` is to use an existing launch template, give `Instance.launch()` the name\n",
    "of the template, and simply override any values you want to change by passing a\n",
    "`dict` to the `options` kwarg of `Instance.launch()`. \n",
    "(On the backend, this is because the API requires a launch template to launch an \n",
    "instance, and reusing the same launch template helps ensure consistent behavior).\n",
    "You can create a launch template using `aws.ec2.create_launch_template()`, \n",
    "other interfaces to the EC2 API, or the EC2 web console. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't do this, `hostess` just creates a 'scratch' template to launch the \n",
    "instance and deletes it immediately after launch (whether successful or failed).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "The EC2 API requires explicit specification of a lot of parameters to launch an instance.\n",
    "`hostess` wants to make it easy to launch instances, so if you don't explicitly\n",
    "specify some or all of these parameters, it populates them with sensible\n",
    "defaults. You can override the following defaults in `hostess.aws.config.user_config`:\n",
    "* instance_type (instance type, like 't3a.micro')\n",
    "* volume_type (root EBS volume type, like 'gp3')\n",
    "* volume_size (root EBS volume size in GB)\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO: complete description of valid `options`**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* If you don't specify a security group, either in a launch template or in\n",
    "  the 'security_group_name' item of `options`, `hostess` acts like\n",
    "  the EC2 web console's launch wizard and creates a new\n",
    "  security group.\n",
    "  * These auto-generated security groups are named 'hostess-'\n",
    "    followed by 10 random lowercase letters. They permit all outgoing traffic\n",
    "    from their members, and permit incoming traffic only on the standard SSH\n",
    "    port (22), and only from your current IP.\n",
    "  * they are associated with automatically-generated SSH keyfiles saved to\n",
    "    your ~/.ssh folder. Their filenames are the same as the names of their\n",
    "    associated security groups.\n",
    "  * `hostess` does not provide automated lifecycle management for these security\n",
    "    groups (this is because deleting security groups associated with running\n",
    "    instances is impossible, and deleting security groups associated with stopped\n",
    "    instances can make them unusable).\n",
    "    This has the same issue as the EC2 launch wizard: it can leave your account\n",
    "    cluttered with old security groups, which are harmless but unsightly. It's\n",
    "    better to reuse existing security groups.\n",
    "* If you don't specify an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), either in a launch template\n",
    "  or in the 'image_id' item of `options`, `hostess` uses the most recent\n",
    "  Ubuntu Server LTS AMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2b. executing `Instance.launch()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hostess` defaults are permissive enough that you can make a new instance\n",
